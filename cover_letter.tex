% Introduction and why I am applying for this role
Early in my degree I developed an interest in compilers and have taken every opportunity to 
learn about and participate in the field. I am excited about this opportunity to work and contribute to 
this field at Apple which is such a leader! From my experience with LLVM and Clang I have been 
awestruck by the projects Apple either started or fostered and what has been achieved. 
Further it is incredible to see how these projects have gone on to shape the products Apple revolutionizes 
the world with and that have been a big part of my life. 
This opportunity stood out to me as precisely the role I want to and the work I can be passionate about and therefore will excel in.

% Credentials and evidence
In my internship at Wolfram Research, my studies, and extracurricular activities I have developed knowledge and 
experience that shows I am equipped for this role and can succeed.
In the internship I proved I can integrate into a team
developing a large, complex, experimental project. I am proud that I successfully contributed to a 
project and that my contributions are being used and build upon by users.
This role and modules such as Parallel Computing and Compilers I excelled at in university have given me
a solid foundation of experience and knowledge and proved my ability in this area.

% Summary and thanks
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about the position and 
to meeting the teams that make the magic happen at Apple.
